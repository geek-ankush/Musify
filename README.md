# Musify - Music Player FrontEnd Design

Musify is a music player web app designed for desktop devices. The project focuses solely on the frontend design and does not include any backend functionality or actual music playback.


## Installation

As this is only a frontend design, there is no need for installation or setup. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the Musify web app.
    
## Usage
The Musify web app is designed to simulate a music player interface, allowing users to browse through their music library and select songs to play. Although the app does not have any backend functionality, users can still interact with the interface by clicking on the different buttons and tabs.

## Tech Stack

- Musify is designed using `HTML and CSS`.
- No external libraries or frameworks are used in this project.



## Future Developments
This project serves as a prototype for a potential music player web app. In the future, additional functionality could be added to the design, such as integrating with a music streaming service or implementing backend functionality for actual music playback.
## Contributing

As this project is designed solely for the frontend, contributions can be made by submitting pull requests for design improvements, user interface enhancements, or any other visual changes that can improve the overall look and feel of the Musify web app.
